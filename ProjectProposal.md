# Project proposal for *House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques Kaggle Competition*
Author: Muhammad Daud Sheikh

## 1. Why: Question/Topic being investigated 1pt

I would like to better understand how to apply regression techniques to predict housing prices and to experiment with finding the best model for this task

## 2. How: Plan of attack 1pt

I will be participating in the House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques, Kaggle competition. I will start off by reading the rules and following the workflow taught in class including:

- Data pre-processing
- Splitting data into test-train sets
- Feature engineering: This will include one-hot encoding the string, and scaling for numerical features
- Grid Search with range of model paramters
- Model validation
- Visualization and conclusion

In addition to following the workflow taught in class I will be using both, the sklearn documentation, as well as any other papers describing regression techniques applied to housing/financial markets

I would also like to explore what features are the primary drivers for the housing prices and for this I would like to explore the effect of different types of feature engineering and visualizing the impact using *model.feature_importances_*

## 3. What: Dataset, models, framework, components 2pts

Dataset: Ames Housing dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
Model: linear regression, Lasso, Bayesian Regression, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent
Framework: Scikit-Learn
